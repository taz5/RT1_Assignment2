 In this assignment we are using a Server-Client since it tends to be more request

 Publisher-Subscriber tends to be for different purposes where you subscribe to
 something, process it and publish it. Usually at a fairly fixed rate. You can subscribe
 to multiple things and publish multiple things. Multiple other nodes can subscribe to
 the same topic. You can even have multiple nodes publishing the same topic.

The rate is in Hz. ros::Rate is a class provided by roslib which akes a best effort at
maintaining a particular rate for a loop . Since the rate is in Hz, we have to 
keep in mind the time (in seconds) and then basically follow the formula f=1/t. Based on
ROS documentations and examples, I will set it to 10Hz which means that t=0.1 seconds.

 decrease or reset the position of the robot.

 needs to increase or decrease, whereas when the reset is requested an Empty Service is called. For an Empty service, no actual data is exchanged between the service and the client.
