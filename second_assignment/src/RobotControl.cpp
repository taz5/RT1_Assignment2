The adverstise function is how you tell ROS that you want to publish on a given topic name.

After this advertise() call is made, the master node will notify anyone who is trying to subscribe to this topic name, and they will in turn negotiate a peer-to-peer connevtion with this node. advertise() returns a Publisher object which allows you to publish messages on that topic through a call to publish(). Once all copies of the returned Publisher object are destroyed, the topic will be automatically unadvertised.
The second parameter to advertise() is the size of the message queue used for publishing messages. If messages are published more quickly than we can send them, the number here specifies how many messages to buffer up before throwing some away.

In our case, we will set this parameter as 1 since we need to be size of the message queue to be once only.
